# Minecraft Auto Server
To engage in local server gameplay, utilize your server's IP address, typically found through the "ifconfig" command (usually 192.168.x.x). However, if you desire to play with friends, you must open a port on your router and permit traffic on that specific port. Please note that this process is applicable only to Linux operating systems.
